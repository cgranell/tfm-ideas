## Master projects done 

### Visualization and visual analytics of geospatial data for psychological treatment
*Summary*: a visualization tool based on Luis' metric analytical framework, which is aimed to better interpret the results of interventions in the treatment of certain psychological disorders such as Agoraphobia or Depression. It was done in collaboration with LABPSITEC. It was developed by EM student Iskandaryan Ditsuhi (2016-2018 promotion) from Sep 2017 to Mar 2018, with the title [Visualization and visual analytics of geospatial data for psychological treatment](http://repositori.uji.es/xmlui/handle/10234/173976). 

### Mental health app builder: a case study to battle addictions
*EM Student*: Fanawani (Fana) Gebremeskel (2017-2019 promotion), from Sep 2018 to Mar 2019

*Hypothesis*: Location patterns from patients's phone sensors are correlated with depressive symptoms. In other words, the extent to which changes in depressive symptoms can be predicted with movement data remains yet unclear. 

*Summary*: In the field of health, the location and movements of a patient is a key resource for the treatment of mental disorders (e.g., depression, agoraphobia, gambling addictions, etc.). Surprisingly, even to date, psychologists mostly rely on pen and paper, asking the patient to meticulously write down their location, movement and habits. Despite the best intentions of the patient, such data is objective and incomplete. Furthermore, there is a delay between the data collection (usually daily), and data delivery and processing (usually during a weekly or bi-weekly session with the psychologist), and the treatment can thus only be adjusted/tailored to the data with the same delay.

Using modern technologies, the cycle of data collection - data delivery - data processing/interpretation can be significantly improved. First, the use of mobile technologies (i.e., GPS, ubiquitous internet connectivity) allows to accurately track and store user’s location and trajectories, and also to interact, in real-time, with the user (i.e., notifications). Second, GIS technologies allow to analyse and interpret the obtained mobility data, and take appropriate actions (e.g., geo-fencing, trajectory analysis, etc.). Third, visualisation and visual analytics allows to visualise and interpret the data in such a way that it specifically support treatments of a mental disorder.

The objective of this thesis is to develop a case study to test the mental health app builder to treat addictions. This includes gathering and understanding the requirements of such an app, generating the app using the mental health app builder, adding new features - if needed - to the mental health app builder, testing the generated app with therapists (access to psychologists/therapists is available). 

We hereby note that, for the requirements gathering, testing and experiments, access to psychologists/therapists is available through GEOTEC collaboration with LABPSYTECH, a group of psychologists/therapists at UJI. This thesis is performed in close cooperation with the creator of the mental health app builder, who will assist with any extensions needed.

*Methods*: Location analysis, JavaScript programming, data visualisation, (possibly Android programming)

*Related work*: At GEOTEC, we developed a mental health app builder, a application generation framework accessible via a web interface, that allows health professionals to generate a mobile application for the treatment of a particular mental disorder. The framework therefore offers some basic geospatial building blocks (location tracking, trajectory recording, geo-fencing), communication building blocks (notifications) and a basic visualisation of collected data by therapists (map-based view). The framework has been successfully tested to build an app to treat depression.

*Notes*: For the tasks of requirements gathering, testing and experiments, access to psychologists/therapists is available through GEOTEC collaboration with LABPSYTECH, a group of psychologists/therapists at UJI. This thesis is performed in close cooperation with the creator of the mental health app builder, who will assist with any extensions needed.

### Mapping the real character of Castellón (meaningful clusters) though the lens of cycling flows and user-generated POIs 
*EM Student*: Fabián Rodolfo Perotti (2017-2019 promotion), from Sep 2018 to Mar 2019

*Hypothesis*: Urban boundaries derived from cycling flows and social POIs reflect better the socio-economic-mobility reality / character of Castellon than the artificial administrative units.

*Summary*: This TFM is aimed to explore to what extent administrative units and emerging socio-economic-mobility clusters in Castellón are disconnected, taking as primary source flows of bike travels along with other urban data sources. Expected results are the identification and mapping of meaningful socio-economic-mobility clusters that better reflect the character of the city of Castellon.

*Context*: This project is part of and is expected to contribute to a larger project called **Where the UJIers go: 10 data visualisations to explain the impact of UJI**. This TFM is intended to find or formulate new questions about (social) pressing issues in urban contexts. Seeing a problem from the geographical dimension can help to understand it better and find novel ways to tackle it. This TFM should also embrace research reproducibility practices.

## Master project proposals (pending to be assigned)

### Impact of the Tobler’s first law of geography.

*Summary*: [Waldo R. Tobler passed away in 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230406.2018.1447399). He was a pioneer in the fields of cartography and GIS. The idea of this thesis proposal is to explore the literature (1970-today) that references or explicitly mentions Tobler's first Law of Geography, *everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things*, to analyse their motives to do so, creating a network of influences of the Tobler law. In what application domains is Tobler's first law of Geography relevant? What is the temporal and spatial variability of the impact of this law? 

*Related work*: [First Law of Geography](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.2307/143141)

*Methods*: literature review, critical review, bibliometric analysis, data visualisation, network analysis.

### Conceptualisation of mobility neighbourhoods through the lens of cyclists
*Hypothesis*: Mobility is a multi-dimensional, multi-faceted concept that may lead to multiple interpretations. 

*Summary*: Much research has put the focus on monitoring mobility behaviour in the sense of detecting differences in the mobility behaviour of distinct profiles of people (or types of transport modes). For example, locals and tourists move differently in a city, as each profile visits more frequently certain places and takes certain routes than the other. Or confronting taxis’ and private cars’ mobility. Assessing **where, when and how** a person travels and moves has been and is the aim of mobility behaviour. 

However, there are different dimensions that make the detection and assessment of mobility behaviour difficult. Scale, for example. Sometimes, we want to study mobility behaviour at an individual level. Other times, we are interested in the aggregation, i.e. group level, to detect overall mobility patterns for urban planning purposes and sustainable mobility/transport policies. No focus, though, has been put in detecting whether a particular individual (or moving object) behaves differently from day to day in terms of mobility (due to new mobility habits, new travel routes, new transport modes, update street network, etc.). Mobility is a multi-dimensional phenomenon. When (temporal dimension), where (spatial dimension) and how (transport mode) are well-understood dimensions of mobility behaviour on past mobility studies. Yet, these dimensions have been studied/seen static because no attention has been put on the dynamics of mobility behaviour itself: why does behaviour change, what (and what not) triggers such changes, how long does that change endure, what impact this change produces, does this impact produce a local network effect to surrounding/nearby people or moving objects, does otherwise it produce a network effect at scale?, etc.

The aim of the thesis is to take a fresh perspective to explore and conceptualise the dynamics of mobility behaviour change from the perspective of cyclists. Mobility behaviour is the result of a set of endogenous (internal) factors (speed, transport mode, etc.) and exogenous (external) factors (weather conditions, built environment, traffic conditions, road type, road conditions, etc.). Based on a replica of human senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch), the idea is to mimic **how cyclists sense mobility and the environment**: sensing organs associated with each sense send information to our brains to help us understand and perceive the world around us. A way to characterise mobility and interaction with other moving objects may be based on the five human senses. 

The focus of this work is to explain the effect that geographic distance (or speed, or visibility) has on cyclists with respect to mobility interactions and, simultaneously, to understand the interplay between the endogenous and exogenous factors and their spatial context. As a result, a proof-of-concept tool to visually test (e.g. isochrone map/lines) the concept of mobility neighbourhoods from cyclists' perspective will be produced. 

*Related work*: Literature on mobility, movement analysis, [thick mobility](thick) as mobility data (trajectories) can only mobilise people and change things when it becomes thick with social and contextual meaning. To link to Diego's open dataset of bicycle trips in cities.

*Methods*: Theoretical approach, literature review, proof-of-concept 

### How diverse are my routes? Innovative visualisations of human trajectories (small multiples)

*Hypothesis*: the diversity of trajectories can be a predictor of depressive symptoms (or other phenomena). 

*Summary*: he goal is to design and generate one or more innovative piece(s) of visualisation in order to explore humans' routes. In general, mobility patterns and behaviour may be useful for a variety of applications, such as urban planning, personal health, contamination or, as the proposed case study in this thesis, mental health. The idea of this thesis is to characterise mobility patterns based on an index of diversity in order to respond to the question: how diverse are patient's routes over the last week, or two weeks? To this aim, the student will explore and develop (novel) visualisation technique(s).

A proposed example type of visualisation is small multiples. The student can work on an improved version of small multiples (coloured, annotations, interactive) as a way to visually compare routes over the past weeks, and so to determine the variability of the routes taken by patients. Small multiples might take the form of a matrix, where each row refers to a patient, and each column refers to a day. As a result, each cell would contain a representation of the trajectory/route, with the aim to make explicit how diverse trajectories are compared to time and patients. How might small multiples be classified (and coloured) based on the index of diversity? Other questions in collaboration with the users of these novel visualisation designs will surely emerge during the project. 

Small multiples is the proposed example visualisation, but the student may also propose his/her own novel visualisation technique to develop.

Resulting code will be integrated into an existing R library/package for innovative analysis and visualisation of trajectory data. Input data will be based on real experiments, collected through the GEOTEC's mental health app builder, In summary, the ultimate goal is to make it easy for everyone (patients, therapists, ...) to understand mobility patterns and behaviour visually.

Title: **New interfaces for spatial operators for kids**

Summary: Kids and young people are increasingly being accustomed to map-based interfaces. Even though they can do basic map interactions such as pan, zoom in, zoom out, and locate landmarks, to understand the use and need of spatial operator is still challenging. The topic aims to design and implement a new way to make the semantics and usage of spatial operators understandable and easy to use for kind and young people.

Title: **Location-based services via street name signs**

Summary: Visitors in cities do not have sometimes GPS connections nor paper maps. An alternative idea can be to use street name signs as proxy for location-based services. Lost users an take a picture of the closer street name sign and the system is able perform spatial services according to the user's location. The underlying idea is to connect both worlds, real and virtual, to solve a problem. This is referred in the literature as "Blended Spaces"

Title: **Geoproximity for unemployment (young) people** 

Summary: Imagine a jobless person strolling the city. As he is approaching to a place (employer) offering a job, he is prompted with the job offer. The employers can create a job add by simply sending a message (twitter, whatup). The idea is to add some value to the traditional “waiter wanted” sign hold on the door.

Title: **Tangible programming with IoT sensors "particles"**

Summary: Inspired by [projectbloks](https://projectbloks.withgoogle.com/), the idea is to use physical blocks or bricks augmented with small IoT sensors to program. The physical combination of blocks will be translated into actual code (i.e. sketch ). Could spatial operators be represented and combined using tangible blocks?

Title: **Users able to process** 

Summary: Over the last few years, the world has gradually transformed from an expensive, slow, focused, planned and conducted collection of data by an ad hoc, massive, unplanned data collection carried out by anyone, at any time and wherever. This transition is exemplified by the decadence of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) until relatively recently in favour of the dominating concept of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). Nevertheless, the processing or analysis had always been beyond the reach of citizens. What we pursue is to democratize the ability of processing spatial data among the large public, educate on spatial operators and on the critical skill of undertanding how data is transformed. Just as VGI has done with the production of data, we want citizens be able to choose how and when they process their data.

Title: **From place of residence to place of activity: spatiotemporal mapping of population density**

Summary: Population is a crucial variable for the social sciences, the geosciences, and for policy support in many domains. Yet, our knowledge of its spatial distribution is still nowadays very incomplete. Population is a temporally dynamic variable, with major shifts in its distribution occurring in daily and seasonal cycles, resulting in rapidly changing densities. While spatially detailed representations of residential population  maps can be used as proxies for night-time population distribution, the distribution of population for other time frames is practically unknown at almost every spatial scale.

The location of population during the day is determined by the location of economic, social and leisure facilities which pull population off their residences, driving commuting flows and other forms of daily trips. Daytime population distribution thus varies greatly from night-time distribution, and it is much more challenging to infer.

Title: **Europeana - Platial analysis, processing and visualisation**

Summary: [Europeana Collections](https://www.europeana.eu/) provides access to over 50 million digitised items such as  books, music, artworks and more. It has a set fo [APIs](https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis) to build applications. Based on a few, key use cases, the idea of the project is to explore the use and exploitation of Europeana Collection resources from the spatio-temporal perspective, to approach these resources to European citzens thorough easy-to-use applications. Much more elaborated work might be platial analysys, as opossed to well-known spatial analysis, to initiate a new research line on Place-based research (Andres' thesis?) related to digital humanities/social science resources.
